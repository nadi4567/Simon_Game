# Simon_Game
- This is a simple "SIMON" game .
- The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.
- It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you.
- Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels.
- I guess that is a game to test your memeory since you need to remember the sequences of colored pads.
